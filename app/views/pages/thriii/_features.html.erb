      <h2>M&sup2; Inventory Management&copy;</h2>
      <p>
        In the real world, Inventory Management is much more than just having a count of the number of units of a product that you have. You want to know exactly how much you have of every product and exactly where it is located. How much is in transit? How much of it is on order? How much of it is defective and creating a negative customer experience? How much is creating a positive customer experience? Your inventory tells the story of your business, and Thriii helps you create a better story!
